            My name is Joanna technically known as <em><b>DevBytes</b></em
            >. Ive always had a passion for the software world basically computer
            science.... although i wasnt opportuned to embrace that passion until
            this year, and so far the jounrney hasnt been so smooth afterall
            <em>"nothing good comes easy"</em> and at times i felt like giving up
            one of the resons being that i was just watching videos and so when im
            stuck id just have to watch more videos which i believe we all can
            believe is <em>boring</em> but thankfully that is where
            <a href="https://altschoolafrica.com/">ALT School</a> came in and
            everything started falling in place little by little because we have
            live classes where we are able to ask questions, we have people who
            are on the same track as ours and so we are able to work together to
            get things done and then there are also learning circles which makes
            it easier for one to mingle and so far id say that if i didnt see the
            light that was at the end of the tunnel before i certainly do now.It has been really worthwhile so far filled with amazing people and friends that have i have helped and learned from. Please feel free to join us in this amazing
            journey by filling your <a href="form">Form</a> right here....your
            highly <b>WELCOME !!!!</b>
